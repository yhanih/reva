## 🔍 What's Good About Your Code

Before listing issues, I want to highlight the excellent practices I found:

✅ **Security**

- Proper use of environment variables
- Row Level Security (RLS) properly configured in Supabase
- Protected routes implemented correctly

✅ **Database**
- Well-designed schema
- Proper indexing for performance
- Click validation via database trigger (server-side security)
- Unique constraints on tracking codes

✅ **Code Quality**
- No linter errors
- Clean component structure
- Proper use of React hooks and context
- Good separation of concerns (services, components, pages)

✅ **UI/UX**
- Modern, clean design
- Loading states
- Error messages for users
- Responsive layout

## 📊 Issue Breakdown

**Total Issues:** 15

| Severity | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Critical | 3 | ✅ Fixed |
| High | 3 | ✅ Fixed |

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Non-Blocking)

These are documented in the bug report but don't block deployment:

1. **46 console.error statements** - These are fine for production but consider using a logging service for better monitoring
2. **No rate limiting** - Users could spam campaign creation (add later if needed)
3. **parseFloat without validation** - Helper utilities created, but not applied everywhere (low risk)
