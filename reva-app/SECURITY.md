# Security Considerations for Reva MVP

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING

**This MVP has a known security vulnerability that allows malicious users to generate fraudulent clicks and drain campaign budgets.**

**DO NOT deploy this to production with real money until the click tracking is moved to a server-side Edge Function.**

## Current Security Model

This MVP implements basic fraud prevention suitable for **demo purposes and internal testing ONLY**. The current architecture trusts client-provided data, which can be easily spoofed.

### Implemented Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - All tables have RLS enabled
   - Users can only access their own data
   - Role-based access control (marketers vs promoters)

2. **Database-Level Click Verification**
   - Server-side trigger validates clicks before marking as valid
   - Rate limiting: Same IP cannot click same link within 1 hour
   - User agent validation: Basic bot detection
   - Budget verification: Ensures campaign has sufficient funds
   - Unique earnings per click (prevents duplicate payouts)

3. **Client-Side Restrictions**
   - Clients cannot set `is_valid` to true
   - Clients cannot set `payout_amount`
   - Verification logic runs in SECURITY DEFINER function

### Known Limitations (MVP)

#### 1. IP Address Trust Issue
**Issue**: The current implementation captures IP addresses client-side, which can be spoofed by malicious users.

**Impact**: An attacker could bypass rate limiting by providing different IP addresses.

**Production Solution**: 
- Deploy a Supabase Edge Function that captures the real IP from request headers
- Use Cloudflare or similar CDN to get true client IP
- Implement server-side click ingestion endpoint

#### 2. User Agent Validation
**Issue**: Basic user agent validation can be bypassed.

**Production Solution**:
- Implement advanced bot detection (e.g., reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha)
- Use behavioral analysis
- Implement device fingerprinting

#### 3. Click Fraud Prevention
**Issue**: Current rate limiting is basic and can be circumvented.

**Production Solution**:
- Implement ML-based fraud detection
- Add device fingerprinting
- Use third-party fraud detection services (e.g., PerimeterX, DataDome)
- Implement conversion tracking and quality scoring

## Recommended Production Security Enhancements

### 1. Server-Side Click Tracking
Create a Supabase Edge Function:

```typescript
// supabase/functions/track-click/index.ts
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts'
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'

serve(async (req) => {
  // Get real IP from request headers
  const realIP = req.headers.get('x-real-ip') || 
                 req.headers.get('x-forwarded-for')?.split(',')[0] ||
                 'unknown'
  
  const userAgent = req.headers.get('user-agent') || ''
  
  // Use service role client for privileged operations
  const supabase = createClient(
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!,
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')!
  )
  
  // Verification and click recording logic here
  // ...
})
```

### 2. Enhanced Fraud Detection

- **Fingerprinting**: Use FingerprintJS or similar
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Track mouse movements, scroll patterns
- **Conversion Tracking**: Verify that clicks lead to meaningful actions
- **Quality Scoring**: Give each click a quality score based on multiple factors

### 3. Budget Protection

- **Daily Limits**: Implement per-campaign daily spend limits
- **Manual Approval**: Flag suspicious activity for manual review
- **Payout Delays**: Hold earnings for 24-48 hours before allowing withdrawal
- **Quality Thresholds**: Require minimum quality scores for payouts

### 4. Monitoring and Alerts

- Set up real-time monitoring for:
  - Unusual click patterns
  - Rapid budget depletion
  - Suspicious IP addresses
  - Bot-like behavior

## For MVP Testing

The current security model is sufficient for:
- Internal testing
- Demo purposes
- Proof of concept validation
- Small-scale beta testing with trusted users

**Not suitable for**:
- Production deployment with real money
- Large-scale campaigns
- Untrusted user base

## Migration Path to Production

1. Deploy Supabase Edge Function for click tracking
2. Implement advanced bot detection
3. Add fraud detection service
4. Enable monitoring and alerts
5. Implement payout approval workflow
6. Add compliance features (GDPR, etc.)

## Immediate Next Steps

Before production launch:
1. Replace client-side IP capture with Edge Function
2. Implement reCAPTCHA or similar
3. Add manual payout approval for large amounts
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Conduct security audit
6. Implement rate limiting at infrastructure level (Cloudflare, etc.)
