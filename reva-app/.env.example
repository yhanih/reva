# Supabase Configuration
# Get these from your Supabase project settings: https://app.supabase.com
# Navigate to: Settings > API
# 
# Copy the Project URL and paste below:
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
#
# Copy the anon/public key (NOT the service_role key!) and paste below:
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# Optional: Base URL for production deployment
# This is used for generating tracking links with the correct domain
# Leave commented out for development (will use localhost)
# Uncomment and set for production:
# VITE_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. NEVER commit this .env file to git (it's in .gitignore)
# 2. NEVER use the service_role key - only use the anon key
# 3. Make sure to set these environment variables in your deployment platform
# 4. Keep your keys secret and rotate them if exposed
