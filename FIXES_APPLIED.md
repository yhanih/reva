## üìã Remaining Tasks (User Action Required)

The following items require manual action:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd reva-app
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
cd reva-app
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Supabase credentials
```

### 3. Set Up Supabase
- Create Supabase project
- Run `supabase-schema.sql` in SQL editor
- Configure authentication settings
- Update CORS settings

### 4. Optional Improvements (From Bug Report)

The following issues from the bug report can be addressed later as improvements:

#### Medium Priority (Not Blocking Deployment):
- Console statement cleanup (can use environment-based logging)
- Input sanitization improvements
- Comprehensive parseFloat replacement with helper utilities

#### Low Priority (Future Enhancements):
- Rate limiting implementation
- Additional monitoring/analytics
- Performance optimizations
